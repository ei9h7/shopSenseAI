# TorqueGPT Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying both the frontend (React app) and backend (webhook server) separately.

## Frontend Deployment (Already Done)

‚úÖ **Status: Deployed to Netlify**
- URL: https://clinquant-starship-25fe89.netlify.app
- Auto-deploys from main branch

## Backend Deployment (‚úÖ COMPLETED)

‚úÖ **Status: Deployed to Render**
- URL: https://torquegpt.onrender.com
- Webhook URL: https://torquegpt.onrender.com/api/webhooks/openphone

## Next Steps

### 1. Add Environment Variables to Render

Go to your Render dashboard and add these environment variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENPHONE_API_KEY=your_openphone_api_key_here
OPENPHONE_PHONE_NUMBER=your_openphone_number_here
BUSINESS_NAME=Pink Chicken Speed Shop
LABOR_RATE=80
DND_ENABLED=false
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 2. Configure OpenPhone Webhook

1. Go to your OpenPhone dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Webhooks
3. Add a new webhook with URL: `https://torquegpt.onrender.com/api/webhooks/openphone`
4. Select "Message Received" as the trigger event
5. Save the configuration

### 3. Test Your Setup

1. **Health check:** Visit https://torquegpt.onrender.com/health
2. **Send a test SMS** to your OpenPhone number
3. **Check logs** in your Render dashboard
4. **Verify response** is sent back via SMS

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://torquegpt.onrender.com/health

# Test webhook endpoint (for debugging)
curl -X POST https://torquegpt.onrender.com/api/webhooks/openphone \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "webhook"}'
```

## Environment Variables Summary

### Frontend (.env for local development)
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
VITE_OPENPHONE_API_KEY=your_openphone_api_key_here
VITE_OPENPHONE_PHONE_NUMBER=your_openphone_number_here
VITE_BUSINESS_NAME=Pink Chicken Speed Shop
VITE_LABOR_RATE=80
```

### Backend (Production environment variables in Render)
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENPHONE_API_KEY=your_openphone_api_key_here
OPENPHONE_PHONE_NUMBER=your_openphone_number_here
BUSINESS_NAME=Pink Chicken Speed Shop
LABOR_RATE=80
DND_ENABLED=false
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Architecture

```
Customer SMS ‚Üí OpenPhone ‚Üí Webhook Server (Render) ‚Üí AI Processing ‚Üí SMS Response
                    ‚Üì
Frontend App (Netlify) ‚Üê Local Storage ‚Üê Message Display
```

## Troubleshooting

### If webhook isn't working:
1. Check Render logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Test health endpoint: https://torquegpt.onrender.com/health
4. Verify OpenPhone webhook URL is correct

### If AI responses aren't working:
1. Check OpenAI API key is valid
2. Check OpenPhone API key is valid
3. Verify DND_ENABLED is set to "true" for auto-responses

### If messages aren't appearing in frontend:
1. The frontend uses localStorage for demo purposes
2. Real integration would sync with the webhook server
3. For now, messages are processed server-side only

## Success! üéâ

Your TorqueGPT system is now fully deployed:
- ‚úÖ Frontend: https://clinquant-starship-25fe89.netlify.app
- ‚úÖ Webhook Server: https://torquegpt.onrender.com
- ‚úÖ Ready for OpenPhone integration
